# Pong-Clone-CPP
This is my attempt to recreate Pong using C++ and SDL3. This was my first project using any version of SDL and my goal was just to learn how the framwork works.

# Deployment Instructions
Download the "pong.exe" file and the "DejaVuSansMono.ttf" file (make sure they are in the same folder). 

# Game Controls

**[Arrow Down]** to move down.
