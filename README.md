# Pong-Clone-CPP
This is my attempt to recreate Pong using C++ and SDL3. This was my first project using any version of SDL and my goal was just to learn how the framwork works.

# Deployment Instructions
Build the "pong.exe" file using MinGW 'deploy', and run the game from the created directory.

# Game Controls
## Player 1:
**[W]** to move up.
**[S]** to move down.
## Player 2:
**[Arrow Up]** to move up.
**[Arrow Down]** to move down.
